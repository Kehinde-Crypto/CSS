   <!-- to center align a div we will use 
     <style>
div {
  width:300px;
  margin:auto;
}
</style>

for a three and above div tags we will use

.mycontainer {
  width:100%;
  overflow:auto; // to be able to make the the div be aligned CSS, the overflow property controls what happens to content that is too large to fit inside its container (like a div or section).  types of overflow visible,hidden scroll auto()
}
.mycontainer div {
  width:33%; // so that since the  the whole with of a system is 100 perecnt so its 100/3
  float:left; // while the float is to the left to make it from straght horizontally it iwll be colse together   
}

To make the CSS flex method work, surround the <div> elements with another <div> element and give it the status as a flex container.

  Sounds almost the same as flex, but has the ability to define more than one row and position each row individually.

  The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The value of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document.

  The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}
